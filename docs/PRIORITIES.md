# Agent POC App Priorities

This document outlines the priorities for the development of the O'Reilly Agent POC application.

## Security

- Expose MCP tools judiciously, ensuring sensitive operations are protected.

## Cost Efficiency

- Optimize LLM usage to minimize API costs while maintaining performance.

## Performance

- Minimize context bloat/pollution; ensure the agent delivers accurate and relevant responses.

## Reliability & Accuracy

- Prevent hallucinations, ensure consistency and correctness of agent outputs.

## Observability

- Enable debugging, decision tracing, logging, and root cause analysis.

## Governance & Compliance

- Maintain audit trails, meet regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA), enforce organizational policies.

## Transparency

- Provide explainability for agent decisions, expose chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Safety & Control

- Implement emergency stops, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, and guardrails against unintended actions.

## Data Privacy

- Protect PII, prevent data leakage, ensure tenant/user data separation.
