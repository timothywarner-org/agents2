# Build Production-Ready AI Agents

## Published by Pearson

**Level:** Intermediate

> Use LangGraph, CrewAI, and Claude MCP to build autonomous agents that both think and act

---

## What You'll Learn

- Build real autonomous agents with LangGraph's stateful workflows and CrewAI's multi-agent orchestration
- Connect agents to everything using Claude MCP servers for databases, APIs, and tools
- Deploy production-ready systems that go beyond demos—actual agents doing actual work

---

## Course Overview

Production-ready AI agents go beyond chatbots—they plan, execute, maintain state, and make decisions independently. This course teaches you to build autonomous agents using the enterprise stack that's actually shipping: LangGraph for stateful orchestration, CrewAI for multi-agent collaboration, and Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for universal tool connectivity.

You'll build a working software development team of AI agents—Product Manager, Developer, and QA Tester—that collaborate to complete real tasks. No toy demos or "hello world" examples. By session's end, you'll understand when agents beat traditional automation, how to architect reliable agent systems, and most importantly, how to avoid the pitfalls that tank 90% of agent projects. This is for developers who need to deliver production systems, not experiments.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this live online course, you'll be able to:

1. **Design and deploy stateful agents** using LangGraph's workflow engine for complex, multi-step reasoning
2. **Orchestrate multi-agent systems** with CrewAI for collaborative problem-solving
3. **Build MCP servers** to connect agents to any database, API, or tool in your stack
4. **Evaluate agent ROI** with a framework for when to use agents vs. traditional automation vs. humans

## Is This Live Event For You?

This course is designed for:

- **Developers** who've heard the "agents" hype and need to separate reality from marketing
- **Software architects** who have experimented with LangChain or similar tools but struggled to move from demos to production
- **Technical managers** who need to make informed decisions about agent adoption for their team or organization

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python proficiency** including async/await patterns and basic API development
- **LLM fundamentals** — you've used ChatGPT, Claude, or similar and understand prompting basics
- **Command-line comfort** with pip, virtual environments, and environment variables
- **API experience** with REST endpoints and JSON — we'll be connecting lots of services

---

## Course Setup

Required tools and accounts:

- Python 3.11+ with pip and venv configured
- Claude API key (Pro account recommended)
- OpenAI API key (for comparison demos)
- VS Code or preferred Python IDE
- Docker Desktop (for MCP server deployment)
- Course repo: [github.com/timothywarner-org](https://github.com/timothywarner-org)
