  "title": "Fix CSV export truncating large datasets",
  "body": "## Bug Report\n\n### Description\nWhen exporting datasets with more than 10,000 rows to CSV, the export is silently truncated. Users expect all data to be exported.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Load a dataset with 15,000 rows\n2. Click Export > CSV\n3. Open the exported file\n4. Count rows - only 10,000 present\n\n### Expected Behavior\nAll 15,000 rows should be exported.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nOnly 10,000 rows are exported, no warning shown.\n\n### Environment\n- Browser: Chrome 120\n- Dataset size: 15,000 rows\n- File size: N/A (issue occurs before file is generated)\n\n### Suggested Fix\nLooks like there's a hardcoded limit in `export_service.py`. Should either:\n1. Remove the limit\n2. Add streaming export for large datasets\n3. At minimum, show a warning to users",
